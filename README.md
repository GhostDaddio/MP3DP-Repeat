# MP3DP-Repeat
This is the MP3DP -Repeat- __Milled/Printed 3D Printer "Repeat"__.  This can be a fun project  to use your new CNC mill for. This is my take on a CoreXY 3D printer, with a CNC mill friendly frame, or even an 20 series extrusion frame, options! 

The Repeat is a whole new take from the previous two designs and I wanted to get a little 
experimental this time around in a few ways.  
* CoreXY instead of a "bed slinger". After two fun [ZenXY](../zenxy/index.md) designs using 
CoreXY I think I have wrapped my head around the strengths and weaknesses of this geometry. 
* More frame options, instead of just material and thickness, you can not opt to use 80 series 
extrusions instead of milled flat parts.
* Direct Belt Driven Z axis. The resolution is there, quiet, fewer unique parts.
* Hardware bed leveling (true bed leveling), and software (mesh leveling). Takes a bit longer to 
get started but flawless first layers are worth it. Time to make more accurate parts.
* Simple Universal tool plate. Mount any extruder, laser, dragknife, pen, etc... 
* Carbon fiber and linear rails. Quiet, accurate, and light where it is needed. The larger the build
 the more noticeable the weight loss.
* [CAD files are available](https://a360.co/381SaiQ)! Edit it to your hearts content, this is an open design and is licensed

* Very few unique printed parts, so editing is simple. 11(?), at last count.
